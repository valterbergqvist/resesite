    <h5>Hanauma Bay:</h5>
    <img class="bild1" src="images/hanaumabay.jpg">
    <p>Formed within a volcanic cone, today Hanauma Bay offers a pristine marine ecosystem after the City and County of Honolulu laid out a plan in 1990 to restore the “curved bay,” after years of use from the millions of visitors who visit and love to snorkel Hanauma Bay. Voted the Best Beach in the United States for 2016 our volunteers have a booth located on the beach level to help visitors learn about conservation of the reef and the types of fish that live there.
    In 2002 a marine education center was opened for visitors and part of the conservation plan requires first-time visitors to watch a 9 minute video before entering the park so they can learn about the marine life, preservation and safety rules for the park. All visitors are required by law to refrain from mistreating the marine animals and from touching or walking on the coral. In the early 2000’s the natural spa called “Toilet Bowl” because of the rise and fall of water with the waves, was closed due visitor injuries and safety concerns.</p>
    
    <h5>Diamond head:</h5>
    <img class="bild2" src="images/diamond.jpg">
    <p>Diamond Head is part of the Ko’olau Range of volcanoes that began erupting below sea level over 2.6 million years ago. A single eruption around 300,000 years ago created the crater. 

    The crater encompasses 350 acres. The crater is much larger than its rim as it was formed explosively. This type of formation is known as a tuff cone. 

    Diamond Head stands at an elevation of 762 feet above sea level. When measured from the crater floor, the Diamond Head Mountain towers to 560 feet. 

    Diamond Head is monogenetic, which means eruption occurs only once. The last eruption of the volcanic tuff cone was likely 150,000 to 200,000 years ago. It has remained dormant since. </p>
    <h5>Waimea Canyon State Park:</h5>
    <img class="bild3" src="images/WaimeaCanyon.jpg">
    <p>
    Waimea Canyon, located in Waimea, Hawaii is dubbed the “Grand Canyon of the Pacific.” The moniker, falsely attributed to literalist Mark Twain, became popular after American explorer John Wesley Powell came to the island of Kauai in 1869.

    Waimea Canyon was formed when the Waimea river carved its way through the lava and basalt formations of the region. The central volcano that lay on the canyon collapsed 10 million years ago, playing a vital role in forming the canyon.
    Traveling across the Waimea Canyon will take you approximately two hours if you spend some time at each stop. If you are planning to travel through the canyon without breaks, you will finish the journey in an hour.

    Two roads drive up to the canyon, meeting at a common point. 552 Kokee Road from Kekaha is the picturesque view up, while 500 Waimea Canyon Road from Waimea is the smoother way down. You should utilize both roads for different sights each way.
